# Windows Window Manager

Have you ever wanted a tiling window manager experience on Windows? Neither have I but I wanted to know if it could be done.
I could've named it wingman but the critics said that wouldn't fly.
I could've claimed it was the G-man of windows but that would limit my ability to make a third version.

## Usage

```console
$ zig run winman.zig
```
